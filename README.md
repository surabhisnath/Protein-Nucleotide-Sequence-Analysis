# Protein Nucleotide Sequence Analysis
This repo contains several simulations performed on protein and nucleotide sequences like 
1) Finding repeats and inverse repeats using Dot Plot 
2) Calculating Atomic and Amino Acid composition from proteins seuqnces in fasta format and perform Kmeans and heirarchical clustering on them 
3) Compute potential vaccine candidates in proteins using ABCpred, CTLpred, ProPred and ToxinPred from gpsrdocker 
4) Implement SVM, ANN and Random Forest on Protein sequences.
